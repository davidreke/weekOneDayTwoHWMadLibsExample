        date, city or town—What was supposed to be a routine apple-picking trip turned into something much more. your name and friend went to famous person's farm to pick apples. This was a funny sort of farm! To get to the orchard, they rode on a(n) type of vehicle driven by famous person! your name and friend went about picking their apples, and they filled two big bags with the most color apples they had ever seen. 
        </p>

       <p> Suddenly, famous person happened to ride by on a(n) animal (singular) and offered to turn the apples into a delicious pie, right there in the orchard. your name and friend didn't believe that this was possible, but they agreed. famous person told them to close their eyes, and before they knew it, the apples were steaming, hot apple pies. your name and friend couldn't believe their eyes! They were so amazed, they ran home and called newspaper. When famous person was contacted about this matter, a reporter was informed that this “miracle” was “just a really adjective practical joke”!
